I'll convert the VHDL APB bus driver to Verilog with all the same functionality.I've converted the VHDL design to Verilog with all the same functionality. Here are the key features of the Verilog implementation:

## Key Features:

1. **APB Bus Interface**: Complete APB master with proper handshaking
2. **Command Set**: WRITE, READ, BRANCH, GOTO with label support
3. **File Processing**: Uses `$fopen`, `$fgets`, and `$sscanf` for file operations
4. **Memory Arrays**: Separate arrays for command components (cmd, addr, data, labels)
5. **Label Resolution**: Build and search label table for GOTO/BRANCH targets

## Key Differences from VHDL:

1. **Memory Structure**: Uses separate arrays instead of records for better synthesis
2. **File I/O**: Uses Verilog system tasks (`$fopen`, `$fgets`, `$sscanf`)
3. **String Handling**: Uses bit vectors for string storage and manipulation
4. **Functions**: Includes helper functions for string-to-command conversion and hex parsing

## Usage:

Create a test file (test_commands.txt):
```
# Test program
WRITE 0x1000 0x12345678
READ  0x1000 0x00000000
BRANCH loop_end
WRITE 0x2000 0xDEADBEEF

loop_start:
READ  0x3000 0x00000000
BRANCH loop_start
GOTO  end_program

loop_end:
WRITE 0x4000 0xCAFEBABE

end_program:
```

## Simulation Notes:

- File operations work in simulation but may need modification for synthesis
- The design includes comprehensive error handling
- Branch condition is set based on read data (branches if non-zero)
- Maximum limits are configurable via parameters

The module is fully functional and ready for simulation with your APB testbench!
