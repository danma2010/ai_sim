Here is the VHDL code for an APB bus driver and CPU master model, designed for simulation and capable of reading a command file.

### VHDL APB Bus Driver and CPU Master Model

This VHDL entity, `apb_bus_driver`, simulates a CPU master that drives an APB bus. It reads a test file containing a sequence of commands to perform APB write and read operations, along with simple control flow instructions.

-- VHDL Entity for an APB Bus Driver and CPU Master Simulation Model
--
-- This entity models a simple CPU master that drives an APB bus. It reads a
-- command file to execute a sequence of operations like write, read, branch,
-- and goto. This is intended for simulation purposes to verify APB slave

### **Explanation and Usage**

#### **1. Entity Definition**

The `apb_bus_driver` entity has generics to configure the command file path and APB bus widths. The ports are standard APB signals along with a clock and active-low reset.

#### **2. Architecture and Internal Signals**

  * **`t_apb_state`**: A state machine (`IDLE`, `SETUP`, `ACCESS`) controls the APB protocol transactions.
  * **Internal APB Signals**: Signals like `s_paddr`, `s_pwrite`, etc., are used internally to drive the output ports. This prevents issues with reading from output ports.
  * **Command File Handling**:
      * `t_command_memory`: A type to store the lines of the command file in an array of `line` types.
      * `v_command_memory`: A shared variable of this type acts as a memory to hold the entire command file. This is loaded once at the beginning of the simulation.
      * `s_program_counter`: An integer that points to the current command line to be executed.
      * `s_end_of_file`: A boolean flag to stop processing when all commands are executed.
  * **Decoded Command Signals**: Signals to hold the parsed components of the current command line.

#### **3. Key Processes**

  * **`file_reader_proc`**:
      * This process runs once at the start of the simulation.
      * It opens the specified command file (`commands.txt` by default).
      * It reads each line from the file and stores it in the `v_command_memory` shared variable.
  * **`command_processor_proc`**:
      * This is the main sequential process driven by the clock and reset.
      * **`parse_line` Procedure**: A local procedure to parse a single line from the command memory. It uses `read` and `hread` (for hexadecimal) to extract the line number, opcode, address, and data.
      * **Main Logic**:
          * On reset, it initializes the program counter and state.
          * In the `IDLE` state, it fetches the next command line based on the `s_program_counter`.
          * It then parses the line and decodes the `s_opcode`.
          * **`write`**: Sets up the address, data, and write signal, then transitions the APB state machine to `SETUP`.
          * **`read`**: Sets up the address and read signal, then transitions to `SETUP`.
          * **`branch`**: Compares the last read data (`prdata`) with the data field of the command. If they match, it updates the `s_program_counter` to the address specified in the command (using the lower 8 bits for simplicity). Otherwise, it increments the program counter.
          * **`goto`**: Unconditionally updates the `s_program_counter` to the address specified in the command.
          * The APB state machine progresses from `SETUP` to `ACCESS` and waits for `pready` before returning to `IDLE` to process the next command.

### **Example Command File (`commands.txt`)**

Create a file named `commands.txt` in your simulation directory with the following format:

```
[line_number] [opcode] [address] [data]
```

  * **`line_number`**: An integer, for user reference.
  * **`opcode`**: A five-character string: `"write"`, `"read "`, `"bran "`, `"goto "`.
  * **`address`**: A hexadecimal value for the APB address.
  * **`data`**: A hexadecimal value for the write data or the data to compare for a branch.

**Example Content:**

```
00 write 00000004 FFFFFF00
01 write 00000008 12345678
02 read  00000004 00000000
03 bran  00000005 FFFFFF00  -- If prdata is FFFFFF00, goto line 5
04 write 0000000C AAAAAAAA  -- This is skipped if the branch is taken
05 read  00000008 00000000
06 goto  00000002 00000000  -- Jump back to line 2
